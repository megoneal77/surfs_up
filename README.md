# surfs_up
## Overview
### Mr. Avy wants to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. First, he wants to analyze temperature data from the months of December and June. He wants to see if the business would be sustainable year-round. TO complete this task, we used sqlalchemy and the following functions imported from sqlalchemy: automap_base, session, and  create_engine, func.
## Results
### As seen in the jupyter notebook file, there is little difference between the temperature in June and December in Oahu. This means there is a good chance an ice cream/surf shop business would last year-round and have good results.
